An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server.
In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the
target and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.

The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.

A reverse proxy (or gateway), by contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web server.
No special configuration on the client is necessary.
The client makes ordinary requests for content in the name-space of the reverse proxy.
The reverse proxy then decides where to send those requests, and returns the content as if it was itself the origin.

A typical usage of a reverse proxy is to provide Internet users access to a server that is behind a firewall.
Reverse proxies can also be used to balance load among several back-end servers, or to provide caching for
a slower back-end server. In addition, reverse proxies can be used simply to bring several servers into the same URL space.
